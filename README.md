This guide provides detailed instructions on building and running the provided Flutter code for the Blog Explorer app that utilizes Bloc for state management and Hive for local storage.

Prerequisites:

Flutter SDK: Download and install the Flutter SDK from the official website (https://flutter.dev/get-started).

Dart development environment: Set up a development environment for Dart using either the command-line tools or an IDE like Visual Studio Code with the Flutter and Dart extensions.

Allows users to favorite and unfavorite blogs.

Shows detailed information for each blog post.


Steps:

Clone the project or download the code.

clone the repository using

git clone <repository_url>.(copy and paste)

If you have the code downloaded as a zip file, extract it to a directory on your computer.

Install dependencies.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to install the required packages:


flutter pub get

Use code with caution.

Â  
Build and run the app.

For Debug Mode: Run the app in debug mode using flutter run. This will launch the app on a connected device or emulator and allow hot reloading for faster development.

For Release Mode: To build a release version of the app, use flutter build appbundle or flutter build apk (depending on your target platform). This will create an optimized build suitable for distribution.


Security: Avoid storing sensitive API secrets like _adminSecret directly in code for production environments. Consider using environment variables or secure storage mechanisms.
